// Redrawn 2026-08-02 at the START of the review-fixes session, because the counter was
// due (and, per MAP STATUS, undercounted: three Casino Run rounds shipped without
// incrementing it). This pass:
//   - Zone 2 gained declarative modifiers and CASINO RUN, both (NEW). Casino Run is five
//     sessions rendered as ONE item on purpose: the rounds finished one idea, and the map
//     renders ideas rather than commits. Roulette, craps and stakes lost their (NEW)
//     highlights, and so did zone 1's pack picker groups.
//   - Zone 3's committed three are now poker / Smash Tournament / tabletop theme.
//   - Zone 5 got the pass it was owed. The casino TV money board bug has been OPEN in
//     BACKLOG.md since 07-30 and was never drawn, which is the exact drift the reconcile
//     step exists to catch. Drawn now, alongside the three open findings this session is
//     about. The 07-29 safe-area item aged out; the 07-30 event-TV one replaced it.
//   - BOTH ROWS GREW, row 2 for the first time in six passes: row 1 990 -> 1120, row 2
//     y 1110 -> 1240 and h 530 -> 660. Zone 2 needed 146px and had 118; zone 5 needed
//     600 and had 530. Raised past the minimum, as every previous pass has done.
//
// Earlier passes, kept short: 2026-07-30 (zone 2 took roulette, craps and stakes; zone 3
// took Casino Run in place of co-op-as-a-format; row 1 920 -> 990) and 2026-07-29 (zone 2
// took Smashdown, the series rows and blackjack; row 1 860 -> 920).

// Layout constants from MAP PROTOCOL: 3 cols x 2 rows, cols at x=40/560/1080
// each 480 wide, row 1 y=95 h=1120, row 2 y=1240 h=660. Items 440x40, 46px
// step, first 50px below zone top; taller boxes for wrapping labels.
